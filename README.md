# Health Check Script

## Introduction
This Python script is designed for performing health checks on various web endpoints. It sends requests to these endpoints and logs their status, helping in monitoring the health and availability of web services.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `requests`, `yaml`, `logging`, `colorama`
- Git (for cloning the repository from GitHub)

## Setup
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
#### Checking and Installing Python 3
To check if Python 3 is installed on your machine, open a terminal and run:
```bash
python3 --version
```
If Python 3 is installed, you will see the version number. If not, you need to install it. The installation method depends on your operating system.

#### For Windows:
- Download the Python installer from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

#### For macOS:
- Install Homebrew (if not already installed) by running in the terminal:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
- Then install Python 3 using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install python3
   ```

#### For Linux:
Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. If not, you can install it using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install requests yaml logging colorama
   ```
3. install git from [the official git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (if not already installed)
4. Place the `health_check.py` script in your desired directory.

To get the health check script from the GitHub repository, use the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PashaSamets/health-check.git
```
This will clone the repository to your local machine, and you can find the `health_check.py` script in the cloned directory.

## Usage

To run the script, you must either be in the cloned directory or specify the full path to the script. Here are two ways to run the script:

1. **Run from the Cloned Directory**:
   Navigate to the cloned directory and run:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/cloned-directory
   python3 health_check.py ./urls.yaml
   ```

2. **Run Using the Full Path**:
   Alternatively, you can run the script using its full path without changing directories:
   ```bash
   python3 /full/path/to/health_check.py /full/path/to/urls.yaml
   ```
To run the script with your own file with web endpoints, replace `./urls.yaml` with the path to your own YAML file. This file should contain the endpoint configurations like URL, request method, headers, etc. The script requires this file to function properly.

To stop the script, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Logging
The script logs its output to a file named `health_check.log`. This file contains timestamps, log levels, and messages related to the health checks performed. Check this file to see the status of each endpoint the script has checked.
